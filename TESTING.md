## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the site along with validation of CSS. I have checked the HTML via url input of the deployed site, so as not to flag errors within the jinja templating, and the CSS has been tested by direct input.

<details><summary>Index HTML</summary>
<img src="static/documents/w3validated_index.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary>Register HTML</summary>
<img src="static/documents/w3validated_register.png" alt="No Errors found.">

<details><summary>Log In HTML</summary>

<details><summary>Profile HTML</summary>

<details><summary>Edit Profile HTML</summary>
<img src="static/documents/w3validated_editprofile.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary>Community Posts HTML</summary>
<img src="static/documents/w3validated_posts.png" alt="One warning.">
</details>

In the community posts page the validator flagged up a possible misuse of aria label in the following code snippet. After reviewing the code and conducting extra tests using samsung talkback and windows narrator I have decided to keep this code as it is.

            <div class="card-reveal">

                <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4"

                 aria-label="Close Post Details">

                        Embrace serenity ðŸŒ¿

                    <i class="hoverable right fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical">

                    </i>

                </span>

><details><summary>Code input for 404 here.</summary>
><img src="static/documents/w3validated_404.png" alt="Jinja templating warnings.">
></details>

### Javascript Validation

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com) has been used to test the vanilla javascript on the site. This flagged no major errors, but there were some warnings for undefined and unused variables. Both undefined variable errors are from code that has been copied from Materialize and all variables have been used within HTML files.

<details><summary>Vanilla Javascript</summary>
<img src="static/documents/blissboost_jshint.png" alt="Javascript Validation with js hint">
</details>

### Python Validation

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) has been used to validate all python code on the site and ensure it is pep8 compliant. This has flagged no errors with the current code.

<details><summary>Python</summary>

### Lighthouse

The lighthouse tool within the chrome developer tools has been used to test performance, best practices, accessibility, and SEO. Desktop and mobile tests have been run for each page.

> Notes for Lighthouse Testing:
>
>* Best practices has been pulled down to 96 across the site due to the site logo being in png. The logo was originally converted to webp but presented issues with rendering correctly and therefore has been left as it for the time being. Future versions of the site may either find a fix for the formatting issue, or a new logo.
>
>* Accessibility score is pulled down on all pages with forms due to poor contrast on form labels using materialize's default form styling. Further exploration with styling frameworks may be required.
>
>* Performance and best practices is pulled down on all pages with images that have been uploaded to the site via url upload. Future versions of the site look to implement image file uploads and compare performance with current results.

### WAVE Testing

Parts of the site have been tested for accessibility with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org), however, areas of the site that require log in details would return the log in page only. The index, register, and log in pages returned no errors, but picked up the same contrasting issues on the materialize form labels as lighthouse.

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility has been tested via narrator for windows and talkback on android. This has highlighted issues with focusing on the floating action button on mobile. Alternative hidden nav links have been added to the navbar for editing profile and adding posts to enable talkback users to access the site fully without impacting the original styling of the site until a solution can be found.
