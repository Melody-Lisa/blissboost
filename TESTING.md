## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the site along with validation of CSS. I have checked the HTML via url input of the deployed site so as not to flag errors within the jinja templating and the CSS has been tested by direct input.
